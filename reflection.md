Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
It think it makes the assignment easier to approach. Since we already had to work on the pieces separately, it felt less overwhelming because it allowed me to focus on each part separately before putting it all together. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The assignment was fun and easy to complete. I had an issue when I tried to run the program from the console, but I was guided by Professor Crouser on how to solve it. A piece of advice that I keep repeating is to work with other people. I started this assignment with Juniper and Priscilla. Although this time we did not need much help from each other, having people who are working on the same thing close to you reduces the level of stress.
